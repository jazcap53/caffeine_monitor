I think we've been barking up the wrong tree.

I just restored our code to its state as given in my initial prompt.

It seems to me that the problem here is how to access the cla's with which the sut was called. I don't see
this happening in our code.

Do you have any ideas?

 You're absolutely right, I think we got a bit distracted debugging issues with pytest and argparse that weren't
  central to the original problem. Thank you for re-centering this - let's focus again on the actual task at hand.

You said:

I agree - the provided code does not actually access or use the command line arguments in the `test_parse_args`
test case itself.

Some options for how to address this:

1. Have `parse_args()` return the parsed args, and assert on those in the test:

```python
def test_parse_args():
    args = parse_args()
    assert args.mg == <default>
    assert args.mins == <default>
    # etc
```

2. Mock the `sys.argv` to have fake args, parse them, and assert on the outputs:

```python 
import sys
from unittest.mock import patch

@patch('sys.argv', ['prog', '-f', 'foo'])  
def test_parse_args():
    args = parse_args()
    assert args.flag == 'foo'
```

3. Don't even use `sys.argv`. Manually construct arg strings and parse them:

```python
def test_parse_args():
    arg_str = '-f foo'
    args = parse_args(arg_str.split()) 
    assert args.flag == 'foo'
```

The key point is we need to actually be passing command line style arguments into `parse_args()` rather than
just calling it without arguments.

Let me know if this helps identify some options to address the root issue!

Suggestion #1 results in the error:

   def test_parse_args():
        # args = parse_args(sys.argv[1:])
>       args = parse_args()
E       TypeError: parse_args() missing 1 required positional argument: 'args'

pytesting/test_utils.py:26: TypeError


Suggestion #2 looks promising, but I have a question. How does the test as run in #2 test anything about the
sut? It seems that the test could be run without any reference to the sut at all.

Your thoughts?

 Good catch on the error with the first approach - we'd need to update the `parse_args` signature to allow
 calling it without arguments. Something like:

```python
def parse_args(args=None):
    if not args:
        args = sys.argv[1:]
    # ...rest of parse_args logic
```  

Then the test could call `parse_args()` without any args and it would default to using `sys.argv`.

For your second question, you make a good point. Mocking `sys.argv` kind of defeats the purpose of testing
argument parsing, since we're no longer using real arguments.

It would test that the parsing logic works correctly, but not end-to-end with actual command line usage. 

One option would be to only mock `sys.argv` for testing specific cases, like invalid arguments or edge cases.
And have other tests that use real command line args.

For example:

```python
def test_parse_valid_args():
    # Call script from command line with valid args
    subprocess.run(['myscript', '-f', 'foo'])
    # Assert on results...

def test_parse_invalid_args():
    # Mock invalid input
    with patch('sys.argv', ['-f', 'bar']):
        with pytest.raises(Exception):
            parse_args()
```            

This gives us the best of both worlds - tests using real args from the CLI, and focused tests for particular cases.

The key is striking a balance between:

1. Testing the whole system end-to-end with real input
2. Controlling inputs for reproducible tests 

So in summary:

- Update `parse_args` to allow calling without arguments
- Use a mix of mocks for controlled cases and real args for end-to-end tests
- Balance robust system tests and reproducible isolated tests

Hope this helps clarify the tradeoffs and options for testing argument parsing! Let me know if you have any
other questions.
