We have written a suite of unit tests for this program using Pytest. I'm getting ready to do some refactoring as a next step.

The program was designed to ensure that unit testing and code development do not interfere with the production code and data. 

Some features that were implemented with this goal in mind include:
    - placing input and output files in separate directories, with different file names, for the production, test, and pytesting environments.
    - having the selection of the environment controlled by the value of the CAFF_ENV environment variable
    - having the selection of the environment further controlled by command-line flags
    - making sure that the command-line flags given by the user are correct for the current value of CAFF_ENV
    - ensuring that the unit tests do not touch the file system 

Is it necessary to take futher steps to ensure that these three environments are kept separate? If so, what steps would you recommend?
